# CIFAR10

A Machine Learning model using a 3 VGG Block Architecture Style.

Below are the summary of my model:

Based off the statistics above, we can say that the model does not overfit not underfit, which is good

Here's another statistics for the accuracy of each classes, plotted using confusion matrix
